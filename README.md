# OpenMOBA
We believe competitive games should be public domain. In the same way no one owns the rights to football (soccer), no one owns the rights to OpenMOBA. Anyone can play!

OpenMOBA is a modernization of the MOBA genre. 

We rethink the expectation of "classic" MOBA mechanics and refocus on teamwork and strategy.


## OpenMOBA vs OpenGames
OpenGames is to OpenMOBA as FIFA is to football (soccer).

OpenMOBA is the game and mechanics. Everythign anyone needs to play the game is included in OpenMOBA. It's fully Open Source and anyone can benefit commercially from it.

OpenGames provides an implementation of OpenMOBA. It includes servers, matchmaking, cosmetics, tournaments - infrastructure that allows players to connect and enjoy the game at a higher level. The OpenGames implementation of OpenMOBa is called "Open Battle Arena" - this is the game name you will find on platforms like Steam.
