# OpenMOBA
We believe competitive games should be public domain. In the same way no one owns the rights to football (soccer), no one owns the rights to OpenMOBA. Anyone can play!

OpenMOBA is a modernization of the MOBA genre. 

We rethink the expectation of "classic" MOBA mechanics and refocus on teamwork and strategy.

## Our Approach to Game Design

At its core, OpenMOBA has no pre-defined heroes. Instead, skills are crafted using a skill-crafting system to specialize your build in-game according to your role and strategy. The base skills use skillshots instead of point-and-click mechanics. 

### Depth from customization
Traditional MOBAs add depth through complexity - Hundreds of heroes and skills are a huge barrier to entry. Players are required to learn unique scenarios and interactions in order to play at the highest level, often without any logical reason for them existing. 

Depth in OpenMOBA comes from customization and combination of simple mechanics.


### Fresh mechanics
Traditional MOBA mechanics are relics of limitations of the first game engine used to create MOBAs. Last hitting, denies, laning, creeps, camp stacking, teleports, click-to-target, gold attribution, etc, are random elements that have been stitched together over the years instead of designed as a whole. 

OpenMOBA rethinks the core mechanics of a MOBA. Modern engines allows us to base our design decisions to optimize them for fun, balance and depth without adding unnecessary or unfriendly complexity.


### A focus on Strategy
OpenMOBA focuses on strategic gameplay and teamwork, instead of individual tactics. Not that tactics are not a core part of the game, but game design will usually tradeoff tactics for strategy.


## OpenMOBA vs OpenGames
OpenGames is to OpenMOBA as FIFA is to football (soccer).

OpenMOBA is the game and mechanics. Everythign anyone needs to play the game is included in OpenMOBA. It's fully Open Source and anyone can benefit commercially from it.

OpenGames provides an implementation of OpenMOBA. It includes servers, matchmaking, cosmetics, tournaments - infrastructure that allows players to connect and enjoy the game at a higher level. The OpenGames implementation of OpenMOBa is called "Open Battle Arena" - this is the game name you will find on platforms like Steam.
